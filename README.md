# 5-Stage-Pipelined-MIPS-Processor
 Detailed implementation of a 5-stage pipelined MIPS processor  in Verilog using i-verilog .Simulation of the core stages which are Instruction Fetch (IF), Instruction Decode (ID), Execute (EX), Memory Access (MEM), and Write  Back (WB).Implentation of register file, ALU, control unit, and instruction/data memory.
